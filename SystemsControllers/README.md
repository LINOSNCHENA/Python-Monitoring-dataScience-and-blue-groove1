# MODEL PREDICTION CONTROLLERS

The problem at hand is to solve a control problem by prediction the future of a dynamic system.  Three different types of models are used . the following are the Model for modern controllers. 
1. CARIMA computations
2. MATRIX computations
3. Diophantine equations

## Current Tasks and Problems
 
Formal and Uniform disturbance is inflicketd. The effectis simulated in MATLAt and performace of controller is observed. Comparisons for the computation based on the disturbance that is inflicted
1. A-E are using Matrix computational method
2. F-J are using CARIMA  computational method
3. K-O are using Diaphonies computational method

## Plots of results

Various results where obtained. The following are the comparison criteria;

1. No disturbance
2. Uniform disturbance
3. Gaussian disturbance
